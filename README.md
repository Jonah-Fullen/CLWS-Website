# CLWS
Created in Junior Year.
Took my former employer's website and created an updated version from scratch for a web development class extra credit.
Employer's active website: claytorlakewatersports.com
They opted to keep their current website so that they (the owner) can maintain it himself rather than rely on someone else (me) to update it if he need to. 

To view my version:
  Option 1: View the screenshots in the folder.
  Oprion 2. Download CLWS file and open CLWS.html in a browser.
